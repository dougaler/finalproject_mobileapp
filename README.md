UC Crime Map service mobile app

## Project Goals
This application can aggregate all crime data around the university to make it easier for students to understand and see safety informaiton around campus

## Instructions for Building The Application
Navigate to `Platforms/Android` and open `AndroidManifest.xml` with the xml editor and add your own Google Maps API key, which we can't include in the git repository for security reasons. You can follow [these instructions](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key#console) to get your own key.

After this all you need to do is let Visual Studio build and deploy the code to your Android emulator.
